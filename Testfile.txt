Washington state health officials said Saturday a person has died of COVID-19,
 the disease caused by the new coronavirus. It is the first reported coronavirus death in the United States.
 The White House announced Wednesday that non-U.S. citizens won't be allowed to travel from Europe to the U.S. for 30 days, in an unprecedented attempt to stop the spread of the new coronavirus. 
 The travel suspension won't apply to the United Kingdom.
